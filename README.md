**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Basic Insights on Hotel Bookings.**  

---

## Overview  
This project involves **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in the hospitality domain, focusing on trends in hotel bookings. Using Python and Pandas, I explored the data, cleaned it, and derived insights to better understand customer behavior.  

---

## Key Features  
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and standardized data formats.  
- **Insights**: Identified booking trends, cancellations, and customer patterns.  
- **Simple Visualizations**: Generated basic plots to support findings.

## Process  
1. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Addressed null values in important columns like `booking_date`.  
   - Standardized formats for consistent analysis.  
2. **Exploratory Analysis**:  
   - Focused on key metrics such as seasonal booking patterns and cancellation rates.  
   - Extracted actionable insights for improving customer satisfaction.  
3. **Visualization**:  
   - Created simple bar plots and line graphs to illustrate findings.

## Tools Used  
- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.  
- **Libraries**:  
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.  
  - Matplotlib: For basic visualizations.  
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step execution and documentation.

## Insights  
- Seasonal trends impact hotel bookings significantly.  
- High cancellation rates during specific periods suggest areas for improvement.  
- Identified patterns that can help optimize hotel management strategies.
